1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,620
okay so this is the last lecture for the class

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:10,460
 and I'm sure that you've got a lot of other things going on as well 

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,780
so thanks for showing up 

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:18,700
today this is as I said last time these two lectures are not part of the course syllabus 

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,880
they're not on the final exam they're more looking to the future 

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:27,119
and in particular what I want to talk about today is some kind of studying I did over the past year 

7
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:27,860
about how the electronics industry
and in particular what I want to talk about today is some kind of studying I did over the past year 

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,470
about how the electronics industry

9
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,660
what we now call the semiconductor

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,010
industry but it might be something

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,530
different in the future as new

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,930
technology comes along but what what

13
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,940
directions it's going to head and will

14
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,320
we be able to assume the kind of

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,780
progress that we've come to know and

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,480
expect over the past several decades

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,050
so in particular and this is important

18
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,230
for obviously for people involved in ECE

19
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,600
but also for people involved in computer

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,180
science and software because the fact

21
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,920
that we have this massive collection of

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,180
computers data centers powerful cell

23
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,970
phones and things obviously the software

24
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,460
people are important to that but the

25
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,040
reality is it's the hardware base that

26
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,460
makes it possible so it's really an

27
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,409
important thing even for software people

28
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,380
to have a fairly decent understanding of

29
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,829
how the actual systems work what their

30
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,409
technology is and what set could look

31
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:35,810
like in the future

32
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,570
so in particular we've been riding

33
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,100
enjoying the benefits of what's commonly

34
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,939
referred to as Moore's law and Gordon

35
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:48,930
Moore is he's still alive and was one of

36
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,159
the earlier pioneers in the

37
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,220
semiconductor industry he worked for

38
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,200
William Shockley who's one of the

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,159
inventors of the transistor and set up

40
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,350
there's a company called Shockley

41
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,689
semiconductor that Shockley set up in

42
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:07,290
the Bay Area in Palo Alto and the wait

43
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,200
in the early nineteen know in the 1950s

44
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,150
somewhere and then he

45
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,849
and a group of them left because

46
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:18,610
Shockley was such a jerk and found and

47
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,610
found a home at an existing company

48
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,989
called Fairchild that did things like

49
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:28,599
aviation electronics and set up

50
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:32,049
Fairchild Semiconductor and so that was

51
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:34,470
really the start of Silicon Valley from

52
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,780
the silicon perspective actually they

53
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,720
were using germanium at the time but

54
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,549
what we think of a Silicon Valley really

55
00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:48,750
got its start there so he was the the

56
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,430
the head of the research part of

57
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,730
Fairchild Semiconductor when he wrote an

58
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:59,200
article for a what's really just a trade

59
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,480
press magazine electronics magazine we

60
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,150
wouldn't consider it a very important

61
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,720
publication these days but back then it

62
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,540
had some fairly leading articles and so

63
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,829
he wrote an article and this is in 1965

64
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:19,930
so almost exactly 50 years ago and what

65
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,470
he done was he just sort of eyeballed

66
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,569
what his company was able to do in terms

67
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:30,060
of of building the very new of

68
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,049
semiconductors and it was the very very

69
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:34,239
early days of integrated circuits when

70
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,760
you could put multiple transistors on a

71
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,930
single chip and what he recognized was

72
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,760
there is sort of a curve of met that on

73
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,419
this axis it's how much does it cost to

74
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:55,359
per transistor to manufacture a system

75
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:58,900
and on the right hand side it's how many

76
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,120
transistors there were on a single chip

77
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,459
and what he observed was through sort of

78
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:06,389
a sweet spot and if you're to the left

79
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:08,799
you're basically you're not putting

80
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,599
enough things on the chip and so you

81
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:14,169
have too many chips and they cost a lot

82
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:16,030
to connect them together and you're not

83
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,579
making use of the technology and if you

84
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,289
go too far to the right then you're

85
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:22,389
trying to squeeze more on that chip than

86
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:24,250
it was economically feasible at the time

87
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,130
and what he also observed was and this

88
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,610
is 65 remember so he was basically

89
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,789
projecting from 3 years worth of data

90
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:37,539
that that curve was dropping that and so

91
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:42,130
this sweet spot was shifting to telling

92
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,260
you what's the optimum number of devices

93
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:49,510
to put on a single chip from like 20

94
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:52,450
here 250 there too and then he projected

95
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,810
out and said well gee by 1970 we should

96
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,490
be able to get a thousand devices on a

97
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,479
chip and that was sort of just a

98
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:04,060
prediction he made and then that became

99
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,570
known as Moore's law and that name was

100
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,690
not made up by Moore but by actually a

101
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:14,889
professor at Caltech so what we now know

102
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:16,900
of is Moore's law was really started

103
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,960
with this prediction and two things are

104
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,639
worth noting one is it's a technology

105
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:25,090
prediction it's based on what this

106
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,250
company and other companies were able to

107
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,669
do but the other was an economic one it

108
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:33,400
was saying if you want to make the best

109
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,380
use of this technology and get the most

110
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,740
sort of electronics for your dollar then

111
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,180
you should be following these principles

112
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,789
so and that that combination is actually

113
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:44,460
quite important

114
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,099
so I went off and found a Wikipedia page

115
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:51,159
that lists a bunch of different chips

116
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,889
for microprocessors and other types of

117
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:59,979
processors that has the both the chip

118
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:03,400
area and how many transistors who were

119
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,520
on that and I mapped it out so it starts

120
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,060
the first microprocessor was the called

121
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:16,719
the 4004 made by Intel in 1971 and up

122
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:18,789
through here you see that I sort of

123
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:20,919
partitioned these into different types

124
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:24,130
of processors so a desktop processor

125
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,930
would be like what you'd have in a PC

126
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,690
and they sort of drove the industry for

127
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,120
this middle part of the time embedded

128
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,159
systems are chips that aren't designed

129
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,050
to be computers that you're using as

130
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,360
computers but they're inside of

131
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,040
something for

132
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,810
example the earliest micro processors

133
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:48,180
the 4004 was created by Intel to to run

134
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,060
a calculus cop calculator built by a

135
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,190
Japanese company they came to Intel and

136
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,070
said could you make us some electronics

137
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,500
to implement this and somebody within

138
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,360
Intel I had the inspiration to say well

139
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,160
if we just implement this as a

140
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,990
microprocessor then we can write the

141
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,180
code to implement a desktop calculator

142
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,130
and it's what they call 4-bit

143
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:11,510
microprocessor so you're used to 32

144
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:15,540
mentioned 4 so the word size is 4 and

145
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,490
how do you do that it's actually you

146
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,460
have to think about how you even do that

147
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,410
but that's what it was a 4-bit

148
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,720
microprocessor so anyways embedded

149
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,000
systems sort of some of these were

150
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,740
really a pre PC era and then these

151
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,290
diamonds are ones that sort of drove the

152
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:38,010
PC era and then the yellow are more

153
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:41,340
recent graphic processor units which are

154
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,470
some of the biggest fastest chips out

155
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,320
there the x's are ones that are really

156
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,510
server class machines for example the

157
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,600
sharp machines and are designed to be

158
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,730
inside of a big computer room and down

159
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,500
here for exempt these blue ones are

160
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,320
actually for cell phones but this is

161
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,420
just this is not a scientific sample

162
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,610
it's just a ones for which I could find

163
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,030
the appropriate data oh and you might

164
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,140
ask why did you start in 1971 if this

165
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:17,460
paper came out in 65 well back in 65 the

166
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,730
technology was what they called bipolar

167
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,260
technology which is not a mental

168
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:27,540
condition here and the it's very

169
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,050
different

170
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,980
so the first microprocessor and all the

171
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,990
successor ones are done in a technology

172
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,440
called MOS which stands for metal oxide

173
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,520
semiconductor which isn't a very useful

174
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:45,000
name but basically chips since the early

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,580
70s have dominantly been using this

176
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,260
technology and the current one is called

177
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,140
CMOS

178
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,450
so anyways the interesting thing you'll

179
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,300
see here is on this vlog scale you'll

180
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,100
see that this doubling every two years

181
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,370
has almost exactly matched what's

182
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:05,050
happened so the gray line is if I just

183
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:11,410
extrapolated from from 50 transistors in

184
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,120
1965 and predicted they would double

185
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,610
every two years you get the gray line

186
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:20,269
and the black line is what I get running

187
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:22,910
a regression on this data and you'll see

188
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,740
that their scopes are exactly the same

189
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,079
and what that means is the doubling

190
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:29,149
every two years is absolutely true and

191
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:32,000
the black line what it says is well

192
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,190
actually they in the early days they got

193
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,800
ahead of a curve somewhat so that the

194
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,339
first microprocessor for example the

195
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:44,390
four thousand four had around well

196
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,120
actually I have the numbers actually add

197
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,959
1700 transistors so not too far off of

198
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,060
what word predicted for 1970 so anyways

199
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,820
that's the point it's an amazing thing

200
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,920
this is held and you might ask why was

201
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,600
like Gordon Moore the the best a

202
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,370
forecaster of the future ever to be able

203
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,670
to nail this number so precisely and

204
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,620
also why do you call it a law so there's

205
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,329
two things going there's a few things

206
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:16,579
going on here first of all this is not a

207
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:20,060
law it's not a law of nature it's not a

208
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,209
law of our country it's not a law of of

209
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:26,180
anything it's just a statement that he

210
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,589
made but also it's become a

211
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:33,470
self-fulfilling aw meaning that because

212
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,940
Gordon Moore who was a very prominent

213
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,880
tourist at that time said this and said

214
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,860
his company in that direction and he

215
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:44,140
then went on to found in tell by the way

216
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:49,220
he and and all of his colleagues and his

217
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,860
sort of burgeoning business have just

218
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,690
been dedicated to the task of making

219
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,899
this a law so it was a prediction but

220
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:59,209
not in a sort of objective sense it was

221
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:02,140
a prediction by somebody who then

222
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,989
motivated other people to fulfill it

223
00:11:04,989 --> 00:11:08,029
so anyways it's pretty interesting that

224
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:10,489
just collect and if you can collect all

225
00:11:10,489 --> 00:11:12,499
kinds of data and you'll find this this

226
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:15,980
this doubling pretty much holds by the

227
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,110
way in general you should whenever

228
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,720
you're looking at a semi-log pot if you

229
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,189
have a straight line that's a sign of

230
00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:27,019
exponential growth so what does this

231
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,360
really mean then it's hard for you to

232
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,959
appreciate how much different the world

233
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,579
of computing is today than it was even

234
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:40,600
20 30 40 years ago so for example in

235
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,579
1976 if you had a lot of money in other

236
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:45,079
words your Los Alamos National

237
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,529
Laboratory and you really wanted a big

238
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:52,040
computer you could buy it by basically

239
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,779
getting a hand-built machine from a

240
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:59,029
company called Cray headed by Seymour

241
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:01,279
Cray who is one of the legendary people

242
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,699
in the world of computing at the time

243
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:06,410
but this machine is you see all the

244
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:10,819
numbers for it are way off what even

245
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:15,559
I've got on my phone and what you have

246
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:18,110
on your phone to write in terms of

247
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:22,040
performance in terms of density this

248
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,639
thing weighed 5,000 kilograms and used

249
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:30,649
115 kilowatts where is now we have these

250
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,360
ones that are powered by batteries and

251
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,279
fit in your pocket and the other is

252
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:37,220
numbers that the whole life of the crane

253
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,660
this was considered an incredibly

254
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,079
successful supercomputer the first real

255
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,779
supercomputer in the whole lifetime they

256
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:47,749
manufactured 80 of them and as you know

257
00:12:47,749 --> 00:12:51,439
phones sell in the millions so it's

258
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:54,169
really very very different world we live

259
00:12:54,169 --> 00:12:58,459
in because of of the progress of

260
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:02,869
integration and so again to put yourself

261
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:07,669
back back in 65 what I can like I'll

262
00:13:07,669 --> 00:13:12,410
date myself I was a young person at that

263
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,919
time and for me the coolest thing to get

264
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:18,350
was a portable transistor radio

265
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:21,230
like this one that would play am

266
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,510
stations

267
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:27,100
okay now today what young teenagers

268
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,080
crave for is a sort of waitest a

269
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,760
consumer product of a high-end phone so

270
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,000
part of it is if you look at this they

271
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,980
even advertise that this transistor

272
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:44,870
radio had nine transistors on it whereas

273
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:49,040
the chip inside of a this is last year's

274
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:56,210
the the iPhone six had has if you still

275
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,730
have one a chip with two billion

276
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:02,810
transistors on it and that's the main

277
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,490
chip there's about eleven chips in an

278
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,410
iPhone in a phone by the way but that's

279
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:10,280
the main processor chip so that's really

280
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,610
the fundamental difference of why what

281
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,860
you've got today is so different than

282
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:21,800
what you could get in sixty five so it's

283
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,560
hard to even think about two billion

284
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,900
transistors and what that really means

285
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,760
so here's an analogy imagine a

286
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,650
transistor where the size of a grain of

287
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,320
sand they're actually a lot smaller than

288
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,780
that but just that's about the smallest

289
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,370
thing you can think of sort of picking

290
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,590
up and feeling then if you look at

291
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:42,770
here's this original four thousand four

292
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,420
had twenty three hundred transistors I

293
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,610
didn't have my numbers quite right so

294
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,430
that's if you think in sand grains it's

295
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,890
um actually I calculated this out it's

296
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:55,670
170th of a teaspoon so just a very very

297
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:59,600
small pinch of sand is about 2,300

298
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,230
grains of sand and nowadays if you think

299
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,170
of two billion transistors in in terms

300
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,020
of sand that's about a 200 pounds of

301
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,160
sand so if you go to Home Depot and you

302
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,110
buy a bag of sand for your children's

303
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:18,650
for somebody's a sandbox or whatever

304
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:22,040
it's about 50 pounds so about four four

305
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:27,850
bags of sand is 2 billion two billion

306
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,280
grains so that sort of where we are

307
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,089
today where

308
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:37,189
sort of a it's the same as if you filled

309
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:40,279
up big Paint Bucket three of them sort

310
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:46,100
of that level we're at so just to give

311
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,459
you a sense where we are and so what I

312
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:51,589
claim is and this isn't just my claim

313
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:55,160
it's sort of self-evident that there's a

314
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,670
sort of virtuous cycle that's driven

315
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,620
that drives the technology and the

316
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,589
economics together so in particular the

317
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:06,439
more things they can sell that they have

318
00:16:06,439 --> 00:16:09,889
chips in them the more money that gives

319
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:12,050
for companies and more incentive that

320
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,209
gives them to invest in research and

321
00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:17,180
development to improve the technology to

322
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,220
buy it's a very expensive capital

323
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,139
equipment to run a semiconductor

324
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:24,170
fabrication facility and so that money

325
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:26,420
comes from ultimately because they're

326
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,699
selling this stuff and because of that

327
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:30,589
they're then able to improve the

328
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:34,129
technology pack more transistors on a

329
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:36,319
chip make them run faster reduce the

330
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:38,990
power all those good things and then

331
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,029
that's coupled with people who are good

332
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:43,100
at a product design and of course the

333
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,679
software designers as well to improve

334
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:48,800
the product so that you want to buy more

335
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,279
stuff right and that causes more sales

336
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,949
so this cycle is very important that if

337
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:58,009
it weren't for that looping around then

338
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:00,100
these improvements wouldn't be happening

339
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,629
so right now the semiconductor industry

340
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:05,089
is worldwide and it's very much a

341
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:07,909
international industry is about three

342
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:09,409
hundred billion dollars a year so it's

343
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:12,529
pretty big and so what does that meant

344
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:14,990
well one is simply let's just take the

345
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,929
example of phones that the iPhone the

346
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:22,000
first iPhone was on 2007 or so and

347
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,130
there's been nine generations of them

348
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,720
including the most recent which isn't

349
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,960
shown this picture and so more or less

350
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,450
every year they come out with a new

351
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,850
phone and for example this phone I'm

352
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,980
carrying around is one I bought this

353
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,120
fall even though I had a phone of from

354
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,920
two years ago that was really okay but

355
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,930
I was sufficiently motivated to shell

356
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:50,060
out the money and now it's not hidden in

357
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,740
our plans anymore so I know this

358
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:57,110
actually cost me $750 but I and many of

359
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,470
my friends and people around the world

360
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,870
did exactly that and created a huge pile

361
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:06,350
of of cash that infused Apple and part

362
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,900
of the reason Apple now is the largest

363
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,150
company in the world in terms of market

364
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:15,850
capitalization so that cycle you can see

365
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,980
here you know better products more sales

366
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,550
you you see that happening all the time

367
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,650
but underneath it all what's driving

368
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,420
that then is the ability to improve

369
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:31,040
these products so you've probably heard

370
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,310
the other kind of stuff people are

371
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,260
talking about is artificial intelligence

372
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,370
and will it basically eliminate all your

373
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,780
jobs and the famous sort of person

374
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,830
behind that it's a guy named Ray

375
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:51,410
Kurzweil and so he proposed this idea

376
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,960
they call the singularity which is the

377
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,990
the day this is I'll just describe it to

378
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,630
you can tell I'm a skeptic on this the

379
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:03,740
day that computers become more powerful

380
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,650
than humans actually that he's not the

381
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,380
one who invented that term then it's all

382
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,520
of a sudden going to create this massive

383
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,690
switchover where the computers are going

384
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,990
to get smarter by teaching themselves to

385
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:22,640
be smarter and so off into infinity

386
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,760
of and making humans obsolete that's the

387
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,120
idea of the singularity and part of the

388
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,060
argument behind this is basically from

389
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:32,900
Moore's Law

390
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,960
so what Kurt's while did in this picture

391
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,810
and it actually started with some work

392
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,600
by a person who used to be the robotics

393
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,070
Institute here was he plotted based on

394
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,740
this his measure was calculations per

395
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,780
second per thousand dollars so how much

396
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,700
computation could you buy for a thousand

397
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,320
dollars and he started back at 1900 with

398
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,640
mechanical adding machines and stuff

399
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,600
like that

400
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,660
and added these plots you see this was

401
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,860
around 2000 and somehow this is an

402
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:11,990
article of amazing a potting he figured

403
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,700
that this wasn't even a straight line it

404
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,090
was an upward curve so an upward curve

405
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:21,050
on a semi-log paper is more than

406
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:24,140
exponential it's like e to the x squared

407
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,190
or something like that right so but

408
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,440
anyways based on that projection and

409
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,070
based on some notion of the relative

410
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,890
power of human versus mouse versus

411
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:40,400
insect brains he came out with this

412
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,030
projection that in 2030 roughly

413
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,170
computers would become smarter than

414
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:49,460
humans and if you just keep that on Kim

415
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,500
eight computers would become smarter

416
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:56,060
than all humans combined so that we can

417
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,940
talk about this projection and I'm sure

418
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,960
you guys do at times too but my point of

419
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,270
it is this argument is fundamentally a

420
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,910
Moore's Law argument right that the

421
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:10,100
argument is basically as computational

422
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,410
power increases because of this

423
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:16,070
continuing progress of technology it's

424
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,170
inevitable that because humans aren't

425
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,000
really getting smarter much of a very

426
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,780
fast rate that it's inevitable that

427
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,460
computers will become smarter than

428
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,410
humans it's sort of the argument but

429
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,120
it's very much based on this assumption

430
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,250
that computer technology is going to

431
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,800
continue to progress at an exponential

432
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,800
pace

433
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,160
so let's now imagine and this is

434
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,920
something that you know you could be

435
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,140
thinking about is is what will this mean

436
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,110
50 years from now so if Moore's law

437
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:51,350
looks back over the past 50 years now

438
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,480
let's look forward for another 50 years

439
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,260
and see what that would mean and what

440
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:01,790
would possibly be so here's a one claim

441
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:05,660
I'll make is that whatever is the most

442
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,370
important thing it will be something

443
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:10,360
that is in the hands of everyone or is

444
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,130
even more ubiquitous than there are here

445
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,620
on the planet right in other words that

446
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,510
what I claim is the thing that will be

447
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:20,120
the most important technology-wise will

448
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:25,400
be what's the largest volume product so

449
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,400
I'm not sure what that will be in 2065

450
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,290
it certainly will not be called a cell

451
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:33,350
phone it won't look like what we think

452
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:37,100
of as a phone after all of all the

453
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,130
things people own cell phones for what

454
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:44,480
do you use it for the least making calls

455
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,650
right at least for me so who knows what

456
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:52,310
it will be but I claim that and this is

457
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,260
a key part of this argument that claim

458
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,440
it's got to be a portable low power

459
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,410
system so it has to be powerful

460
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,180
computation but as to be physically

461
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:06,880
small and it can't draw much power and

462
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,100
that will be and so it might be you know

463
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,470
the Internet of Things where everything

464
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,000
is networked together and there's

465
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,580
computer chips or various chips and

466
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,430
everything that those kind of things

467
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,230
would also have the kind of volumes

468
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:25,720
needed to drive the market forward so

469
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,970
based on that sort of let's make that

470
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:31,130
one part of assumption is whatever

471
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:33,740
drives the future it's going to be

472
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,980
something that is portable low power and

473
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,010
low cost you know consumer grade or

474
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,020
something that you can afford to just

475
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,510
sprinkle across the whole planet or

476
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,820
across the whole galaxy if we're beyond

477
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,760
Earth at that point so that means for

478
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,080
example that it's not going to be a

479
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,770
quantum computer right quantum

480
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:56,210
cholesterol so make breakthroughs in

481
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:00,230
superconducting something that you have

482
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,800
to cool down to near absolute zero

483
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,230
requires a big room a lot of equipment

484
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:10,370
and a lot of power and a lot of things

485
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,110
to manage it so you're not going to

486
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,790
carry that around in your pocket I can

487
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,520
promise you that so all the people

488
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,590
talking about a quantum computer well we

489
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,240
can just rule that out that's not going

490
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,820
to be the the most important thing out

491
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:26,070
there but it

492
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:29,910
and it also you know if you could

493
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,770
imagine building this huge machine

494
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:36,720
that's occupies many acres of buildings

495
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,340
that's not going to be the most exciting

496
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,160
thing out there because it's it there's

497
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,020
not enough of those to sort of drive the

498
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,480
market and without that market there

499
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,250
won't be in the investment in the

500
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,640
technology so it has to be inexpensive

501
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,890
and what if we think of it in computer

502
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:56,220
science terms big o-notation it can't be

503
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,620
you know the cost to produce these

504
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,770
things can't be very much so for example

505
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:04,410
the chip that's in the cellphone that

506
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:07,740
Apple AAA costs somewhere between ten

507
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,040
and twenty dollars for Apple to procure

508
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,890
that from its suppliers which are in

509
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:16,950
Taiwan and in Korea so they're not very

510
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,170
expensive

511
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:21,330
that said it need not be anything based

512
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:23,460
on the technology we use today as I

513
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,560
mentioned currently things are CMOS and

514
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,820
it's been some kind of moss MOS since

515
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,090
the 1970s so for a long time but

516
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:35,220
probably won't continue to be that way

517
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,900
at least not the way we know it and

518
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,360
there's various other ideas people have

519
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,840
had for future computer technology that

520
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,310
beyond this and some of it's being

521
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:48,990
worked on here at CMU and I will predict

522
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:51,960
what those could be but they have to

523
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,640
have these characteristics s being

524
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,010
expensive has being low-power has to be

525
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:03,930
scalable so that's my one assumption

526
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,510
then I'm going to add is whatever it is

527
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,250
we're going to want a lot of them a lot

528
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,720
of transistors or devices of some sort

529
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,370
so what does that mean if we project

530
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,800
that out in terms of how many devices

531
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,110
are on a chip not not how many

532
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,930
transistors but devices so one great

533
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:23,970
thing about semi-log pots is you can

534
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:25,940
just extrapolate to your heart's content

535
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,010
so if we just run those two curves that

536
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,770
I showed you before out ah you get

537
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:34,500
somewhere we'll just you know pick a

538
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,570
number that's sort of roughly in the

539
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:38,880
middle of those two projections of ten

540
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,390
to the seventh

541
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:47,309
so 10 to the 17th things devices in a

542
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:50,250
single integrated system of some kind

543
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,510
that would be what we'd be looking at so

544
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:57,030
how big is 10 to the 17th well if we go

545
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,610
back to our sand analogy this is a

546
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:02,070
picture I found on the internet of some

547
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:04,679
young man in Brazil on the beach

548
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:07,890
making a scale model of the Empire State

549
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:12,659
Building out of sand so my estimate is

550
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:16,559
this is roughly something like 3 billion

551
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,409
grains of sand in that thing I didn't

552
00:27:19,409 --> 00:27:23,010
count them I have to admit but so so

553
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,840
think in terms so something you know

554
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,240
roughly the same scale I showed you of

555
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,919
those four bags of sand from Home Depot

556
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:31,770
something that's roughly comparable to

557
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:34,500
what we'd get on a chip today if if

558
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,450
transistors were the size of a grain of

559
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:39,299
sand so what does 10 to the 17th mean

560
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:42,330
well if you actually built a sand model

561
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:45,000
of the Empire State Building at one to

562
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,200
one scale right then that's a million

563
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,500
cubic meters and then if you made two

564
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,039
replicas of that then and some of those

565
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:58,110
three together then you'd get about 10

566
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:02,400
to the 17th grains of sand so of course

567
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,230
we're assuming this is going to be

568
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,700
something a lot smaller than a grain of

569
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,470
sand but just to give you a sense of

570
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:10,350
scale of how big a change that would be

571
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:14,280
going from a few billion to 10 to the

572
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,280
17th is a pretty big jump in terms of

573
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:23,450
how many devices are involved so let's

574
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:26,429
figure out how could we make things you

575
00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:29,460
know let's just say well let's just try

576
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,340
running the numbers and seeing what

577
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,080
would happen if we just took our current

578
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,330
technology which is more or less what

579
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:39,840
we've been using since 1970 of putting a

580
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,110
lot of transistors on a single chip

581
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,940
actually I happen to bring some toys

582
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:50,000
with me today this is a wafer

583
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,610
so this is what comes through a

584
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:56,300
fabrication plant and it's got typically

585
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,570
about 700 individual whether they called

586
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:00,800
dye on them

587
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,620
the then they slice up and they put in

588
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,840
packages so these are some old packages

589
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,380
but now on your phone or your laptops

590
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,570
whose packaging in there so they package

591
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:15,100
the the chips inside of there so

592
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,750
typically then this is the current size

593
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:21,530
that a company manufactures a diet it's

594
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:24,350
30 centimeters so about 1 foot in

595
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:28,520
diameter and you get about 700 chips on

596
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:28,700
it

597
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,130
chips are typically around one square

598
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:34,820
centimeter so let's just say well let's

599
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:38,180
just take that technology which over the

600
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,940
years these these die of

601
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,790
these chips have gotten the wafers have

602
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,890
gotten bigger the dive gotten a little

603
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:48,350
bit bigger and we've also been able to

604
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:51,260
make much finer geometries on these

605
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,580
chips so let's sort of see how we've got

606
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,890
this over history and what the

607
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:01,670
projections that would mean and what the

608
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:04,790
data show is that the way we've achieved

609
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,670
is sort of doubling every two years in

610
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:10,850
how many transistors were on a chip is

611
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,800
one the trips have gotten bigger they've

612
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,040
doubled in size at a rate of once every

613
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,950
10 years and also the geometries have

614
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,680
gotten finer that we've they've doubled

615
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:25,250
in size or halved in size well the

616
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:28,670
density we can get as a result has gone

617
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:33,770
by a factor to every about four times in

618
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,720
ten years and so you sum those up you

619
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,450
get five doublings every ten years and

620
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:42,770
that's how you get more squat so in

621
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:45,830
particular if you look at the earliest

622
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:48,440
chip the four thousand four was about

623
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,690
twelve square millimeters so that it's

624
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:54,290
pretty small and a modern chip is

625
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:57,700
typically around a square centimeter so

626
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:03,010
and this is actually to scale to a

627
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:05,360
there are some bigger chips out there

628
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,100
and they're not really blue they just

629
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,550
did this to make it look nice but IBM

630
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:13,520
for example makes a server where the

631
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:18,790
chip size is almost 10 times larger than

632
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:22,010
than this processor so you can get some

633
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:25,010
pretty big dye out there but those are

634
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:28,160
typically only and also some GPUs can be

635
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,440
pretty big dice so those are used either

636
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,570
in servers or in places where they're

637
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:35,390
pretty specialized for more portable

638
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,250
battery-powered things you have to go

639
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:42,140
with smaller chips so this is the data

640
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,110
showing the area for these different

641
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,930
microprocessors for time and you can see

642
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:49,550
that you're kind of all over the map so

643
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:52,780
it's a little risky to do any kind of

644
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,670
extrapolation here but this is where I

645
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,980
got the number that it's doubled roughly

646
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:02,600
every 10 years the area of the chip so

647
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,870
if we project that out then then we get

648
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:09,350
something of 173 square centimeters so

649
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:11,180
those of you metrically challenge that

650
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,010
number probably doesn't mean much to you

651
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:16,340
but just to give you a sense like if I

652
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:20,000
just extrapolated then by the Year 2065

653
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,150
I should be up to the Apple model a 59

654
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,750
because right

655
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:32,510
today's the a6 of s and so anyways and

656
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:35,690
well as we said 10 to the 17 transistors

657
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:38,840
it will be 173 square centimeters the

658
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,940
problem with that is it's actually

659
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,370
bigger than a dollar bill it's about two

660
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:46,430
dollar bills in size 173 square

661
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,380
centimeters and you're not going to fit

662
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,350
that in your pocket unless you have

663
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:54,860
really big pocket so that is not the way

664
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,050
things are going to work we can't just

665
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:59,390
keep scaling up area and expect that to

666
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:03,320
happen well the other factor which is we

667
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,360
showed is more critical as things have

668
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,210
gotten smaller and so the way I'll I'll

669
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:11,120
measure that is I'll take this measure I

670
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,720
call L this linear metric

671
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,600
of chip density I'll say the area of

672
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,870
that chip divided by the number of

673
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:23,030
transistors and so one way to think

674
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,980
about it is if the transistors were

675
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,920
spread in a sort of uniform grid across

676
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,250
a chip then their spacing would be this

677
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,530
number L of course they're not there

678
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,540
they're denser in some places and more

679
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,310
spread out and others but sort of if you

680
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:39,770
think of this as a way to look overall

681
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:42,110
how close we packed our transistors to

682
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:46,490
each other oh and this is the curve you

683
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:50,420
get from our existing set of processors

684
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,400
and you see this one really is a pretty

685
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,370
strong trend of getting a finer and

686
00:33:55,370 --> 00:34:02,390
finer geometries over time and it's so

687
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:06,170
the linear scale it drops by a factor of

688
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:09,140
two every five years but if you think

689
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:12,680
about the number of things the density

690
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,520
therefore goes by a factor of four every

691
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:22,610
five years and so that's or equivalent

692
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:24,080
we have gotten twice as many transistors

693
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,290
in a given area every two and a half

694
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:32,860
years

695
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,780
and we can see that again in practice

696
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:40,270
that if you measure out for the Intel

697
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:45,360
4004 it comes out to 72,000 nanometers

698
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,250
10 to the ninth meters is this measure

699
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:52,420
and where's EPEL a 8 is 211 nanometers

700
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,940
so those you know about chip technology

701
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,770
might know that the AAA

702
00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:02,500
was manufactured with what's called a 22

703
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,340
nanometer process so when they measure

704
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,590
when you hear people talking about a

705
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,600
process you know the the actual

706
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,130
fabrication process and they give a

707
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,160
number of nowadays and nanometers what I

708
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,770
mean is the sort of closest spacing you

709
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,990
can make two wires on a chip the sort of

710
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:23,410
finest geometry there but this measure L

711
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:26,440
is bigger because it counts for not just

712
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,840
out what how closely you can pack wires

713
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:32,110
but all the other stuff you have to put

714
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,940
transistors there you have to route

715
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,980
power and ground and signal wires to

716
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,110
them and they have to be isolated from

717
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,850
each other so this is actually a more

718
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:42,160
useful measure of of the effect of

719
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:48,340
spacing on a chip um so just to again if

720
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,620
you're not so familiar with this kind of

721
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:54,010
geometry let's just give you some idea

722
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:58,800
of it so this range in nanometers then

723
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,720
between a thousand and a million then is

724
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,730
is sort of something smaller than a

725
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:06,760
millimeter right a million nanometers is

726
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,880
a millimeter so a thousand nanometers is

727
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,120
a micron or a micrometer and so this

728
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,750
range which is where semiconductor

729
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:20,880
processing was up till ten years ago

730
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,380
you'd call it the submillimetre range

731
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:26,740
and in this it's in the sub micrometer

732
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:29,410
range so just to give you some sense of

733
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:32,500
what those scales mean and I'll point

734
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,300
out that it's pretty incredible to talk

735
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,580
about something over six orders of

736
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,400
magnitude in scale right that's in the

737
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,350
physical world six orders of magnitude

738
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:45,349
is a lot so again if you look at here's

739
00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:48,289
examples of things of how big is a

740
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:53,029
micrometer often called a micron so you

741
00:36:53,029 --> 00:36:57,079
know things at the are almost visible at

742
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:00,619
this scale a human cell how thick a

743
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:05,809
piece of plastic saran wrap is how thick

744
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:11,180
a a strand of spider silk is gives you

745
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,569
some rough number and so this Intel chip

746
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:17,049
from the seventies was somewhere in that

747
00:37:17,049 --> 00:37:22,099
range and now if we look somewhere

748
00:37:22,099 --> 00:37:26,299
between a nanometer and a micrometer and

749
00:37:26,299 --> 00:37:29,119
again this is a log pot or so these

750
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,239
things go pretty fast so for example all

751
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:35,420
a visible light is in this range between

752
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:39,499
400 and 700 nanometers and the the

753
00:37:39,499 --> 00:37:42,049
spacing of transistors on an Apple chip

754
00:37:42,049 --> 00:37:45,019
are therefore closer than then the

755
00:37:45,019 --> 00:37:48,229
wavelength of visible light by the way

756
00:37:48,229 --> 00:37:50,180
which makes for kind of a challenge for

757
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:54,259
manufacturing something like how thick

758
00:37:54,259 --> 00:37:56,779
is a cell membrane or how what's the

759
00:37:56,779 --> 00:38:00,200
diameter of a strand of DNA are down in

760
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,140
just a few nanometer range what they

761
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,390
call carbon nanotubes which people

762
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:08,210
predict will be possibly a successor to

763
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:10,400
transistors their diameter not their

764
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,869
length is one nanometer so those are

765
00:38:14,869 --> 00:38:17,180
pretty small when you're getting down

766
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:20,989
here and nowadays modern processes

767
00:38:20,989 --> 00:38:22,789
they're trying to create features down

768
00:38:22,789 --> 00:38:26,089
in this range of 14 nanometers for

769
00:38:26,089 --> 00:38:30,529
example okay but we can do our our plots

770
00:38:30,529 --> 00:38:33,529
and if you just project out you'll get

771
00:38:33,529 --> 00:38:38,059
down to this linear spacing of 230 Pico

772
00:38:38,059 --> 00:38:41,029
meters in 50 years so what does that

773
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:45,049
mean how big is a Pico meter well Pico

774
00:38:45,049 --> 00:38:46,940
meter is really small in fact if you

775
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,609
look at the spacing between two atoms in

776
00:38:49,609 --> 00:38:55,549
a silicon crystal they're about 1/2 of a

777
00:38:55,549 --> 00:38:59,030
nanometer and if you look at the space

778
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,030
thing between the two atoms in a

779
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:04,580
hydrogen molecule there are 74

780
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:08,180
picometers so what the main thing to

781
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,280
realize is this ain't going to happen

782
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,430
there is absolutely no way that we'll be

783
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:15,320
able to create systems where things are

784
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,460
spaced only 230 Pico meters apart

785
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,350
right because presumably whatever we

786
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,790
build is going to be bigger than a

787
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:28,580
hydrogen atom or molecule so or you know

788
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:33,770
so this really is not in the range of

789
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,630
physically possible and that's one of

790
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:38,180
the annoying things that physics has

791
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,460
sort of gotten in the way of progress

792
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:45,230
recently so in particular you know could

793
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:48,830
we imagine then let's just suppose we'll

794
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:51,860
allow a chip we'll say let's let a chip

795
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:55,360
be as big as 400 square millimeters just

796
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,790
about twice as big on a side as a

797
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:02,480
current chip current standard chip that

798
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,630
would still require this spacing metric

799
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:09,410
of 63 Pico meters wait a minute is that

800
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:14,690
right yes because I'm not allowed to

801
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:17,560
make chips the size of $2 bills

802
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:22,640
so it requires even finer spacing here

803
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,140
and we saw that's just 63 Pico meters is

804
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:30,410
actually closer than the two atoms in a

805
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:32,630
hydrogen molecule the two nuclei in a

806
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:37,730
hydrogen molecule so the answer is no

807
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:39,650
this isn't going to happen this just

808
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:43,130
point is not possible at least not you

809
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:45,020
know so we have to back off and say well

810
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:47,360
what's our defect on our thinking one is

811
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,920
to assume that we're going to just take

812
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,070
this current technology of two

813
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:55,390
dimensional things and just shrink it

814
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:58,340
and one reason we look at that way

815
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,870
because that's exactly what's happened

816
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:03,800
over the past 50 years but we have three

817
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,720
dimensions in this world and so maybe

818
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:09,020
there's some prospect there so let's say

819
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:12,430
instead okay let's imagine

820
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:16,390
a little brick of stuff and I'll just

821
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,100
make up some numbers I'll say it's 2

822
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,590
centimeters on a side and 5 millimeters

823
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:23,920
high it's almost exactly the same shape

824
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,160
and volume as a stack of five nickels

825
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:33,870
and so and now let's just imagine okay

826
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:37,450
how are we going to integrate a bunch of

827
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:38,950
things well presumably we're going to

828
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:43,240
build it out of layers and so let's just

829
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,520
assume that there's about a hundred

830
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,700
thousand layers worth of stuff and those

831
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,230
are what I'll call logical layers

832
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:55,420
meaning that they'll be about a million

833
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,490
physical layers because we have to have

834
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:00,580
wires and these whatever we're building

835
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:03,160
will be just these totally flat things

836
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:07,330
nowadays there's a modern chip has more

837
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:16,630
like 20 physical layers on it so but the

838
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,160
point is that we'll have to have about a

839
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,230
million physical layers worth of stuff

840
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:23,220
to get a hundred thousand logical wires

841
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:27,180
but that would allow us a spacing on the

842
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:30,750
linear spacing of about 20 nanometers so

843
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:34,960
20 nanometers is a lot better than a 63

844
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,100
picometers right if we go back 20

845
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:43,900
nanometers is up in here so it's really

846
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,860
really small but it's not it's not

847
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,620
beyond a physical possibility let's just

848
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,310
put it that way so you can imagine some

849
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:56,140
technology that would give you that so

850
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:00,420
at least at some level it's it's vaguely

851
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,980
you know it's aggressive but but

852
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:08,380
possible to imagine in 50 years be able

853
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,840
to manufacture in a shape like that

854
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,250
something with 10 to the 17th devices

855
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:19,680
but there's a few problems one is

856
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,120
actually the manufacturing how we do

857
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,640
actually do this is no small thing

858
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,170
another I'll talk about some is

859
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,420
do we do this and not spend a whole lot

860
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,220
an exorbitant amount of money doing it

861
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:33,100
and the other is a huge huge problem of

862
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:36,060
power consumption how can we actually

863
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,700
have a system that complicated and keep

864
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,070
it at the limited energy level we have

865
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:44,890
available so let me go into that some

866
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:48,130
more so just is a sort of tutorial the

867
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:50,260
way these chips are made and part of the

868
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,030
reason they're so cheap is it's it's

869
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:55,170
sort of a photo process meaning that

870
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:59,230
every step of the way is done by putting

871
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:02,290
a some kind of material down and

872
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:06,690
exposing it to a light a laser light and

873
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:09,940
then that's this material that you put

874
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:13,210
down as light-sensitive and so there's a

875
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:15,400
mask that defines how things should be

876
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,880
patterned and the light only hits where

877
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,610
the mask is allows it to and that's how

878
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:24,220
you get different shapes and things and

879
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,800
you can either add material or you can

880
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,110
remove material by these masking steps

881
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:32,560
so nowadays a modern chip takes about 60

882
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,920
of these steps we're involving a mask

883
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,590
and some type of either depositing

884
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:40,600
something or removing something or

885
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:44,650
shining light on it or a beam of ions or

886
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:48,760
some other process step to do it so it's

887
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,630
very complicated than the technology is

888
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:54,190
quite remarkable but what you could say

889
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:59,830
is that the even though there's a couple

890
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,900
billion transistors on a chip

891
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:05,050
it still is a constant time process some

892
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:07,980
fixed number of steps and it's done and

893
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:11,560
each successive generation maybe the

894
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,420
number of masking steps is increased a

895
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,700
little bit over time but roughly

896
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,250
speaking it's always a constant time

897
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:22,050
operation and it turns out that the

898
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:25,300
bottleneck in this and the performance

899
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,840
one is actually this photolithography

900
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:32,760
exposing the chip the the the wafer

901
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,740
using a mask and the way that's done

902
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:38,710
nowadays is a machine called a stepper

903
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:39,820
that

904
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,790
basically is used to scan over the wafer

905
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:46,810
and expose with a laser sort of flashing

906
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:52,060
as it goes to expose the wafer to this

907
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:56,170
mask and so current-day that's done it a

908
00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:03,790
on a size of about eight hundred nine

909
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:05,860
hundred square millimeters so you know

910
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:09,850
about this bigger size how much they can

911
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,020
expose at a time

912
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:13,510
and the the fastest steppers out there

913
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:15,430
can do a whole way for in 18 seconds

914
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:18,690
which is pretty good if you think of

915
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:22,660
waving over this whole area flashing and

916
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,460
exposing it with extremely high

917
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:28,440
resolution and very high alignment of

918
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:32,830
reliability well but that's sort of the

919
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:35,590
thing that sort of limits how many chips

920
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:38,080
you can run through a fabrication

921
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:41,830
facility per day is this stepper and the

922
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:43,540
stepper is the most expensive piece of

923
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:46,510
machinery in the building so you don't

924
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:48,730
want to buy a whole lot of them so

925
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:51,330
that's sort of my point is that

926
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:53,860
lithography is the expensive thing so

927
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:56,020
every layer we have to do if we have to

928
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:58,140
expose it using this technique is

929
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:02,380
expensive and so there's no way you

930
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:06,100
could do a million layer system using

931
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,650
photolithography and keep the expense

932
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:12,010
down to the range where it would be

933
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:13,780
something you or I would would be able

934
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,870
to afford as a consumer device as I said

935
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:18,820
a modern chip is somewhere between ten

936
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,940
and twenty dollars so we're not talking

937
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:25,960
a lot of money right if you increase

938
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,300
that cost by a hundred then people

939
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,950
aren't going to buy it because if you

940
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:32,350
think if a ten dollar chip powers at

941
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:36,850
$700 phone then there's a big multiplier

942
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:40,150
there so there's various options you can

943
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:42,190
imagine one is what they call chemical

944
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:44,920
self-assembly where basically whatever

945
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:48,280
you're having sort of patterns itself

946
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,670
just like the crystals would in a you

947
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:53,200
know in a block of

948
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,760
or something like that if you can

949
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,130
imagine various chemical processes where

950
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:59,890
things just form into the particular

951
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:02,109
shapes so this is an area that's been

952
00:48:02,109 --> 00:48:05,769
tried and worked on for electronics for

953
00:48:05,769 --> 00:48:07,690
several decades and never really

954
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:09,990
succeeded yet but maybe that's possible

955
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:14,349
and another possibility would be some

956
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:19,119
interesting ideas in in multiple working

957
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:21,549
with multiple layers at once so in

958
00:48:21,549 --> 00:48:25,660
particular one technology that's really

959
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,910
been able to scale into three dimensions

960
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:30,700
are flash chips and that's part of the

961
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:34,539
reason why my phone has 64 gigabytes I'm

962
00:48:34,539 --> 00:48:37,029
not bragging I'm just telling you my

963
00:48:37,029 --> 00:48:39,369
phone has 64 gigabytes of memory you

964
00:48:39,369 --> 00:48:42,250
know why is there so much memory a flash

965
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:45,130
memory available on it flash as you know

966
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:48,369
is sort of the the storage of choice in

967
00:48:48,369 --> 00:48:51,849
a solid-state disk on cell phones

968
00:48:51,849 --> 00:48:57,390
nowadays and so it's a it's based on

969
00:48:57,390 --> 00:49:01,150
semiconductor devices so for example

970
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:05,529
this is a electron micrograph of a chip

971
00:49:05,529 --> 00:49:08,619
from Samsung showing how they are able

972
00:49:08,619 --> 00:49:13,500
to create a sort of three-dimensional

973
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:18,009
layering of of memory cells so basically

974
00:49:18,009 --> 00:49:24,369
every spot in x y&z here is a 1 bits

975
00:49:24,369 --> 00:49:27,880
worth actually 2 bits worth of memory

976
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,299
cell and there's some device there that

977
00:49:31,299 --> 00:49:34,119
can store it and then there's ways that

978
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:36,460
you can access it to either read it or

979
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:40,900
write it and they're able to do it this

980
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:44,829
whole layering but by using only a fixed

981
00:49:44,829 --> 00:49:47,710
number of masking steps so basically

982
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:50,140
what they start off with is they build

983
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:53,740
up layers without any masking and then

984
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:56,440
they put some masks there and then they

985
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,690
zap down and they can sort of carve away

986
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:04,269
up using basically ion beams to carve

987
00:50:04,269 --> 00:50:07,059
down wherever the mask is and pattern

988
00:50:07,059 --> 00:50:09,579
then they can pour various types of goop

989
00:50:09,579 --> 00:50:12,489
in there that will fill up these spaces

990
00:50:12,489 --> 00:50:17,710
and so by some patterning only at the

991
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:20,019
very top layer they can actually create

992
00:50:20,019 --> 00:50:23,739
this three-dimensional matrix of memory

993
00:50:23,739 --> 00:50:29,200
cells and they can now the most recent

994
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,180
technology gets about 48 layers and

995
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,279
there's projections that they'll be able

996
00:50:33,279 --> 00:50:34,690
to keep doing that at least through

997
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:37,029
several hundred layers so my point is

998
00:50:37,029 --> 00:50:39,700
that you can actually do you don't

999
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:42,309
necessarily need to do masking at every

1000
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:45,730
single layer to create a 3-dimensional

1001
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:49,960
structure now this doesn't scale in an

1002
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,930
obvious way to computers or

1003
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:54,670
microprocessors or anything with

1004
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:57,609
computation it relies very heavily on

1005
00:50:57,609 --> 00:51:00,900
the fact that the particular circuit of

1006
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:07,180
flash memory is very simple and fairly

1007
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,999
easy to build in this 3-dimensional

1008
00:51:09,999 --> 00:51:12,670
structure but at least this is the kind

1009
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:14,799
of idea of what will have to happen if

1010
00:51:14,799 --> 00:51:15,970
we're going to get this kind of

1011
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:19,930
integration

1012
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:23,000
but here's the harder one and this is a

1013
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,060
problem just in general we're already up

1014
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:29,810
against a serious power issues now so if

1015
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:36,250
I look at a modern phone it only draws

1016
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:38,990
even when it's sort of working hardest a

1017
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:41,570
couple of watts typically when it's just

1018
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:44,030
if you want to walk around if you want

1019
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:47,990
to have the battery be good for a day at

1020
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:50,420
a time it has to draw a lot less power

1021
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:55,130
than that so typically when your phones

1022
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:59,690
in standby it's only drawing a few a few

1023
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:01,970
milliwatts so maybe a hundredth of a

1024
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:05,540
watt but when it needs to like you've

1025
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:08,510
just taken a picture and it wants to do

1026
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:10,280
some image processing on it or you're

1027
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:13,160
taking a video or something like that it

1028
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:16,960
can crank up to a couple watts of power

1029
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,119
so why can't it go more than that one is

1030
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:21,770
as I mentioned is the battery but the

1031
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:25,099
other is if your phone draws more than a

1032
00:52:25,099 --> 00:52:27,140
few watts then you won't really want to

1033
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,490
walk around with it in your pocket

1034
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:30,530
because it'll be too hot so you know

1035
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:33,020
just imagine a 25 watt light bulb if you

1036
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:34,490
put that in your pocket and walked

1037
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:37,730
around as far as the extension cord

1038
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:40,040
would let you that wouldn't feel too

1039
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:44,810
good so that limits the power isn't just

1040
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:47,420
battery or so even if we come up with

1041
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:49,250
better battery sources the other thing

1042
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:52,730
is cooling so contrast that to the human

1043
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:56,359
brain is actually pretty amazing as a

1044
00:52:56,359 --> 00:52:59,839
low power system so a human brain

1045
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:03,880
contains roughly 64 billion neurons up

1046
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:08,210
but it and it draws a few tens of watts

1047
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:14,180
so more there's reasons then that so

1048
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:15,920
it's a higher powered thing than a phone

1049
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,050
but it's still a very low power system

1050
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:20,660
so high power it's partly that it's a

1051
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,250
liquid-cooled system your brains

1052
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:25,329
circular your body circulation system

1053
00:53:25,329 --> 00:53:27,980
puts a lot of its work into keeping your

1054
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:30,710
brain from overheating and your body's

1055
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:33,520
metabolism are you

1056
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,619
for example you guys sitting here each

1057
00:53:35,619 --> 00:53:38,100
of you are drawing about sixty watts so

1058
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:41,320
you like a 60 watt light bulb but about

1059
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,540
a quarter of that power is is powering

1060
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:45,970
the neurons in your brain so it's a

1061
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:48,760
fairly big chunk of the human energy

1062
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,540
budget is the brain which makes sense

1063
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,980
but it's still more power than we're

1064
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,200
really going to allow in our portable

1065
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:00,430
devices if we don't want to our pits to

1066
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:06,990
catch on fire and now the crazy thing is

1067
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:11,050
but wait a minute I wanted to go up to

1068
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:14,290
10 to the 17th of these devices five

1069
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:17,020
hundred thousand times more and I don't

1070
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,750
want to add any more power to this so

1071
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:21,820
how is that going to happen well it's

1072
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:23,380
certainly not going to happen with the

1073
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:25,150
technology we have today that's just

1074
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:28,030
can't possibly meet those so we'll have

1075
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:30,900
to have some fairly radically different

1076
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,280
technology from a power perspective as

1077
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,430
well and this goes also not just for

1078
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:39,060
portable devices but even room size

1079
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:42,160
building size computers for example

1080
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,920
right now the fastest computer in the

1081
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,290
u.s. is at Oak Ridge National Labs

1082
00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:50,230
it's called Titan the fastest in the

1083
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:53,140
world it's in China and both of them

1084
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:58,789
draw

1085
00:54:58,789 --> 00:55:04,519
roughly 10 megawatts okay of power so

1086
00:55:04,519 --> 00:55:07,849
the high-end supercomputers and one of

1087
00:55:07,849 --> 00:55:12,469
the goals that the supercomputing people

1088
00:55:12,469 --> 00:55:14,209
talk about is to scale up to what they

1089
00:55:14,209 --> 00:55:16,880
call exascale meaning the ability to do

1090
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,299
10 to the 18th operations per second

1091
00:55:20,299 --> 00:55:22,130
whether they call flops floating-point

1092
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:24,380
operations per second so if you just

1093
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:26,779
took Titan and said okay we want to make

1094
00:55:26,779 --> 00:55:29,150
it go a hundred times faster we'll just

1095
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:34,400
put more so for example Titan is built

1096
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,759
out of 28,000 micro processors and

1097
00:55:37,759 --> 00:55:41,869
28,000 GPUs so if we just go crank all

1098
00:55:41,869 --> 00:55:45,319
that up by a factor of 100 then you're

1099
00:55:45,319 --> 00:55:50,719
talking Costa gigawatt of power so and

1100
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:53,929
just roughly in rough terms the entire

1101
00:55:53,929 --> 00:55:57,319
output of the Hoover Dam is is would be

1102
00:55:57,319 --> 00:56:00,019
enough to power a one gigawatt system so

1103
00:56:00,019 --> 00:56:03,559
a a small nuclear power plant could do

1104
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:06,529
it too but the point is power is going

1105
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:09,469
to be a big issue for both portable

1106
00:56:09,469 --> 00:56:12,919
things and for all of computing as we go

1107
00:56:12,919 --> 00:56:16,880
forward okay so that's sort of some of

1108
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:21,109
the technical challenges accommodation

1109
00:56:21,109 --> 00:56:24,049
but another is an economic challenge is

1110
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:27,679
that it turns out that semiconductor

1111
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:31,579
business has become more capital

1112
00:56:31,579 --> 00:56:35,359
intensive and harder to to sustain and

1113
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:38,359
so this is a example of all the

1114
00:56:38,359 --> 00:56:41,630
companies that we're able to manufacture

1115
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:45,529
chips at different physical sizes so

1116
00:56:45,529 --> 00:56:47,769
that it's a little bit out of date the

1117
00:56:47,769 --> 00:56:52,130
the latest chips are are 14 nanometers

1118
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:55,459
but you see that we're basically down to

1119
00:56:55,459 --> 00:56:58,489
four companies in the world who have the

1120
00:56:58,489 --> 00:57:01,569
wherewithal to manufacture Stevi our

1121
00:57:01,569 --> 00:57:06,919
semiconductor systems and and so and

1122
00:57:06,919 --> 00:57:09,380
these are just to let you know TSMC is

1123
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:12,210
Taiwan semiconductor manufacturer

1124
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:16,440
they're huge in producing chips for

1125
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:19,380
other customers basically what they call

1126
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:21,960
a foundry so other designs come in so

1127
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:27,720
for example TSMC historically has been

1128
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:30,630
the main vendor for Apple for almost all

1129
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:33,800
Android phones are manufactured by GSM C

1130
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:37,050
Intel you know Intel but they very much

1131
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:40,700
rely completely for their business on on

1132
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:43,589
microprocessors and other things they

1133
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:50,130
are that and they only with a small

1134
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:51,960
exception only manufactured chips for

1135
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,770
their own use their own company Samsung

1136
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:59,280
as you know is in Korea is a leading

1137
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,099
manufacturer and a lot of what they do

1138
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:05,060
is produce chips for Samsung products

1139
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:08,970
but they also are one of the biggest

1140
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:12,390
vendors of memory they also actually

1141
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:14,700
interestingly manufacture some of the

1142
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,410
chips for Apple so if you think about

1143
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:18,630
the phone business who are the big

1144
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:23,880
competitors Samsung Apple but Samsung

1145
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,950
actually builds Apple's chips Apple has

1146
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:28,080
no manufacturing capabilities whatsoever

1147
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,150
and then the fourth one is the one

1148
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:32,460
called Global Foundries which is a

1149
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:35,630
company that sort of swept up all the

1150
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:40,950
second string players and it's actually

1151
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:44,570
owned by the sovereign wealth fund of

1152
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:48,900
the Abu Dhabi so one of the United Arab

1153
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:53,640
Emirates so really if you're you can

1154
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,540
sync then there's two companies in Asia

1155
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:59,910
one that's headquartered in Abu Dhabi

1156
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:02,640
but it's actually physically other

1157
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,859
manufacturing facilities are in the u.s.

1158
00:59:04,859 --> 00:59:10,680
in Germany and in Singapore Intel all of

1159
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,810
its manufacturing is in the u.s. Taiwan

1160
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:15,240
is at least for the leading-edge all in

1161
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:19,369
Taiwan and Samsung they have a fab in

1162
00:59:19,369 --> 00:59:23,490
Texas and in Korea so anyways my point

1163
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:24,930
is

1164
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:27,030
isn't very many if you think of a 300

1165
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:29,010
billion dollar industry and sort of

1166
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:31,530
where we're betting our future on you

1167
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:33,330
only have four companies really that are

1168
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:34,740
in the business right now is a little

1169
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:37,830
bit scary and as you see if this trend

1170
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:40,490
continues things wouldn't go well in

1171
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:44,070
particularly if we want innovation and

1172
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:46,290
progress to happen we need competition

1173
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:49,620
and if the number of companies drops too

1174
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:52,130
small then the competition won't be as

1175
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:54,650
significant either so these are

1176
00:59:54,650 --> 01:00:00,760
interesting questions

1177
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,950
another thing that's making life

1178
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:05,930
difficult and it's been making life

1179
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:07,820
difficult for the last 10 years is

1180
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:10,370
what's sometimes referred to as Dennard

1181
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:12,890
scaling and this is a term that you'll

1182
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:16,580
hear said nowadays and just a few years

1183
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:19,130
ago if you mention that term people

1184
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:20,420
would have no idea what you're talking

1185
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:20,990
about

1186
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:23,440
unless you were pretty heavy into chips

1187
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:26,270
but there's a fellow named Robert Denard

1188
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:29,780
who has had a long career at IBM he

1189
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:32,180
actually got his PhD here from Carnegie

1190
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:35,930
Tech in the 1950s and among other things

1191
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:39,470
he invented the dynamic RAM so d Ram you

1192
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:43,220
know he's the guy but he wrote a very

1193
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:46,940
interesting paper in in 1974 that sort

1194
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:50,210
of sketched out why it is that by

1195
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:52,700
shrinking chips we a life gets better

1196
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:55,900
and it's a very simple model sort of

1197
01:00:55,900 --> 01:01:00,200
simple area geometry basics of Ohm's law

1198
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:05,150
kind of stuff that that tells you what

1199
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:08,360
it's doing but he said imagine we can

1200
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:12,410
shrink a chip all the features on a chip

1201
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:16,490
by a factor of some number K typically

1202
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:20,060
we say 2 or the square root of 2 so if

1203
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:23,780
you can shrink in both of x and y

1204
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:27,320
directions by a factor of K and this is

1205
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:30,500
a big important hand and we also reduce

1206
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,540
the supply voltage to the chip by that

1207
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:35,900
same factor then obviously we're going

1208
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,300
to increase the number of devices by a

1209
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:43,910
factor of K squared right but also we'll

1210
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:46,030
be able to make these run faster and

1211
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:49,430
we'll be able to do it without requiring

1212
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:52,160
more power per chip so if all this

1213
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:55,730
scaling holds then we can get more stuff

1214
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:59,510
on a chip run it faster and not use more

1215
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:02,360
power so that's sort of the principle of

1216
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:06,050
Dennard scaling and that's really what

1217
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:11,270
was followed by the industry for from

1218
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:14,610
about 75 to about

1219
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:19,950
2004 this is a chart that shows how

1220
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:22,270
technology progressed so the top curve

1221
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:25,050
here is Moore's law how many transistors

1222
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:28,060
were on a chip

1223
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:32,140
this next curve down was how fast could

1224
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:35,530
a microprocessor go running a single

1225
01:02:35,530 --> 01:02:37,990
thread of execution and you see it was

1226
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:42,010
following a sort of nice steady growth

1227
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:45,100
curve what was the frequency the clock

1228
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:47,710
frequency of the chip you saw also

1229
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:50,620
followed this nice growth curve until it

1230
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:54,070
hit about 2 gigahertz how many watts per

1231
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:56,290
chip well it's kind of variable but it

1232
01:02:56,290 --> 01:03:03,130
was more or less it was scaling faster

1233
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:05,470
than Dennard scaling predicted but still

1234
01:03:05,470 --> 01:03:08,980
pretty reasonable and how many cores

1235
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:11,890
would we put on a chip well it was one

1236
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:13,540
for a really long time and then they

1237
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:16,390
started adding more so that the main

1238
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:18,750
point to notice is

1239
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:22,780
somewhere actually it was a right around

1240
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:27,340
2005 things stopped progressing Moore's

1241
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:29,800
law continues it continues today we can

1242
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:33,250
get more stuff on a chip than before but

1243
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:35,860
how fast are given thread goes has not

1244
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:38,590
really improved much in the past of 10

1245
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:41,260
years and that's why the shark machines

1246
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:43,750
which are already 5 years old are

1247
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:49,290
actually pretty viable computers which

1248
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:54,220
and the number of watts has went leveled

1249
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:57,760
off not because that's the best thing

1250
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,190
computing wise but that's because you

1251
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:06,760
just can't afford to the cost the actual

1252
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:10,380
electricity cost as well as all the

1253
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:12,810
requirements for cooling and things that

1254
01:04:12,810 --> 01:04:16,360
comes with increased power and so that

1255
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:18,250
combination is the reason why we've gone

1256
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:22,120
multi-core that we couldn't get improved

1257
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,790
single-threaded performance but we could

1258
01:04:24,790 --> 01:04:27,340
improve the number of transition

1259
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:29,320
per chip so what do we do we just make

1260
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:37,660
more cores and so my so so some will

1261
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:39,460
tell you that Moore's law is already

1262
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:42,940
dead in the sense that for a while there

1263
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:44,830
is this sort of miraculous things just

1264
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:46,090
kept getting better and better every

1265
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:49,510
year because of Moore's law and now

1266
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:51,520
we're already in an era that even though

1267
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,470
the transistor density part of Moore's

1268
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:55,420
law holds some of these other

1269
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:58,960
performance factors have not improved so

1270
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,900
it's in all ready getting difficult to

1271
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:05,440
sort of out use this technology to make

1272
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:10,060
things faster and more powerful and so

1273
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:11,560
I'll mention for example part of the

1274
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:14,230
reason why this phone actually I don't

1275
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:15,760
know how many transistors are in this

1276
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,310
phone but if you think at two billion

1277
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:20,740
transistors the model before that had 1

1278
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:23,440
billion you say well what's what all

1279
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,840
these transistors doing part of what

1280
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,490
they've done is and part of the reason

1281
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:30,790
they're able to keep the power down is a

1282
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:33,940
lot of what's on a they call the the

1283
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:35,460
chip now it's not called a

1284
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:37,720
microprocessor it's called a system on a

1285
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:38,080
chip

1286
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:41,350
because embedded on it will be a couple

1287
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:45,700
of arm microprocessors several graphic

1288
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:49,150
processing units to handle the video the

1289
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:51,700
image processing and other specialized

1290
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:53,710
pieces of hardware that are only used

1291
01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:56,290
for very specific things so for example

1292
01:05:56,290 --> 01:06:01,570
there's a JPEG encoding and decoding is

1293
01:06:01,570 --> 01:06:03,640
directly integrated into Hardware on

1294
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:07,000
this chip there's a actually some

1295
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,270
special logic for when you take

1296
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:12,850
panoramic shots and then you merge those

1297
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:15,490
all together which I don't know about

1298
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:17,110
you but I don't do that very often

1299
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:19,780
but there's still some special dedicated

1300
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:21,640
Hardware on those chips to do that

1301
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,050
because it takes a lot of power

1302
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:25,750
otherwise so in general if you can take

1303
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:29,560
a some compute computing and turn it

1304
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:32,560
from software and migrate it to hardware

1305
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:35,380
you get a big performance increase and a

1306
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:37,960
major power reduction so they're putting

1307
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,700
more stuff on a chip not to give you

1308
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:40,910
more possible

1309
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:44,630
full processor but to be able to do more

1310
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:48,230
stuff at lower power so that's why these

1311
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:51,590
chips get more so my point is that

1312
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:53,240
they're already sort of we're already in

1313
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:57,410
an era when the driving reason for

1314
01:06:57,410 --> 01:06:59,990
Moore's Law isn't so much to get raw

1315
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:02,120
performance out of these systems but to

1316
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:05,710
give you more features of various sorts

1317
01:07:05,710 --> 01:07:13,880
okay so looking to the future then as I

1318
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,820
said if you can look at since 65 it's

1319
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:21,560
been a very long set of incremental

1320
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:24,380
improvements to get from the chips of

1321
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:27,920
Gordon Moore's early career to where we

1322
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:30,640
are today we got more stuff on a chip

1323
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:33,920
vastly more capable much more affordable

1324
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,380
huge impact on it but from a technology

1325
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:38,330
point of view has been a fairly

1326
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:40,940
incremental road to travel we can see

1327
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:42,380
that that's not going to work in the

1328
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:43,670
future we're not going to be able to

1329
01:07:43,670 --> 01:07:48,800
scale transistor logic to the level that

1330
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:53,960
you'd need to keep this going so at

1331
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:57,980
least two-dimensional semiconductor

1332
01:07:57,980 --> 01:08:01,390
chips aren't going to carry the way so

1333
01:08:01,390 --> 01:08:04,190
they're sort of issues then and you and

1334
01:08:04,190 --> 01:08:05,990
your careers will be dealing with these

1335
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:10,010
is will we be able to build systems of

1336
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:12,440
this complexity in a way that's

1337
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:14,650
commercially viable because if it's not

1338
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:16,820
economically viable it's just not going

1339
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:19,460
to happen and power is going to be a

1340
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:23,090
huge problem as we go along and then you

1341
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:24,770
know what would it mean if you actually

1342
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:28,430
had 10 to the 17th I can't think of what

1343
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:31,400
possible capabilities this would give us

1344
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:35,390
that we'd actually want use but again if

1345
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:38,300
I don't think Gordon Moore would have

1346
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:40,310
thought back in 64 actually if you look

1347
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:42,710
at the 65 paper I recommend you do he

1348
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:44,120
actually did predict things like

1349
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,500
personal computers and cell phones

1350
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:49,370
believe it or not it's really true um so

1351
01:08:49,370 --> 01:08:52,340
he was definitely pretty good but for me

1352
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:54,460
I can't predict what I

1353
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:56,830
have in 50 years what I do with it and

1354
01:08:56,830 --> 01:09:00,010
then for more the software people you

1355
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:01,780
know what what mean will there be

1356
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:05,910
programming we certainly won't be

1357
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:09,130
writing lines of code in C in order to

1358
01:09:09,130 --> 01:09:11,920
power systems like this so what will

1359
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,170
that mean for the future those are all

1360
01:09:14,170 --> 01:09:19,780
big questions that you and this point of

1361
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:21,790
your careers get to look forward to so I

1362
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:26,400
I wish you the best in doing that
