Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.60,0:00:03.62,csapp,,0,0,0,,okay so this is the last lecture for the class
Dialogue: 0,0:00:04.52,0:00:10.46,csapp,,0,0,0,, and I'm sure that you've got a lot of other things going on as well 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.58,0:00:11.78,csapp,,0,0,0,,so thanks for showing up 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.38,0:00:18.70,csapp,,0,0,0,,today this is as I said last time these two lectures are not part of the course syllabus 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:18.84,0:00:21.88,csapp,,0,0,0,,they're not on the final exam they're more looking to the future 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:22.42,0:00:27.86,csapp,,0,0,0,,and in particular what I want to talk about today is some kind of studying I did over the past year 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.38,0:00:32.20,csapp,,0,0,0,,about how the electronics industry
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.20,0:00:36.08,csapp,,0,0,0,,what we now call the semiconductor industry but it might be something different in the future 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.74,0:00:38.96,csapp,,0,0,0,,as new technology comes along 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.50,0:00:40.16,csapp,,0,0,0,,but 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.24,0:00:46.88,csapp,,0,0,0,,what what directions it's going to head and will we be able to assume the kind of progress 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.98,0:00:51.36,csapp,,0,0,0,,that we've come to know and expect over the past several decades
Dialogue: 0,0:00:52.06,0:00:52.98,csapp,,0,0,0,,so in particular 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.74,0:00:58.60,csapp,,0,0,0,,and this is important for obviously for people involved in ECE
Dialogue: 0,0:00:58.60,0:01:02.16,csapp,,0,0,0,,but also for people involved in computer science and software because
Dialogue: 0,0:01:02.84,0:01:13.18,csapp,,0,0,0,, the fact that we have this massive collection of computers data centers powerful cell phones and things 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.86,0:01:16.90,csapp,,0,0,0,,obviously the software people are important to that 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.92,0:01:21.08,csapp,,0,0,0,,but the reality is it's the hardware base that makes it possible 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.04,0:01:26.42,csapp,,0,0,0,,so it's really an important thing even for software people to have a fairly
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.08,0:01:31.32,csapp,,0,0,0,, decent understanding of how the actual systems work
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.46,0:01:35.38,csapp,,0,0,0,, what their technology is and what set could look like in the future
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.72,0:01:42.74,csapp,,0,0,0,,so in particular we've been riding enjoying the benefits of what's commonly referred to as Moore's law 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.00,0:01:46.70,csapp,,0,0,0,,and Gordon Moore is he's still alive 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.24,0:01:51.64,csapp,,0,0,0,,and was one of the earlier pioneers in the semiconductor industry 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.16,0:01:56.88,csapp,,0,0,0,,he worked for William Shockley who's one of the inventors of the transistor 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.60,0:02:04.74,csapp,,0,0,0,,and set up there's a company called Shockley semiconductor that Shockley set up in the Bay Area in Palo Alto 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.54,0:02:10.98,csapp,,0,0,0,,and the wait in the early nineteen know in the 1950s somewhere 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.82,0:02:14.40,csapp,,0,0,0,,and then he and a group of them 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.02,0:02:17.10,csapp,,0,0,0,,left because Shockley was such a jerk 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.84,0:02:22.78,csapp,,0,0,0,,and found and found a home at an existing company called Fairchild 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.38,0:02:31.32,csapp,,0,0,0,,that did things like aviation electronics and set up Fairchild Semiconductor and so 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.72,0:02:36.68,csapp,,0,0,0,,that was really the start of Silicon Valley from the silicon perspective 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.38,0:02:39.50,csapp,,0,0,0,,actually they were using germanium at the time but
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.02,0:02:43.52,csapp,,0,0,0,,what we think of a Silicon Valley really got its start there 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.98,0:02:52.42,csapp,,0,0,0,,so he was the the the head of the research part of Fairchild 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.30,0:02:56.60,csapp,,0,0,0,,Semiconductor when he wrote an article for a 
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.56,0:03:01.38,csapp,,0,0,0,,what's really just a trade press magazine electronics magazine 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.40,0:03:05.46,csapp,,0,0,0,,we wouldn't consider it a very important publication these days 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.48,0:03:09.76,csapp,,0,0,0,,but back then it had some fairly leading articles 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.28,0:03:12.56,csapp,,0,0,0,,and so he wrote an article
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.26,0:03:17.82,csapp,,0,0,0,, and this is in 1965 so almost exactly 50 years ago 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.58,0:03:22.60,csapp,,0,0,0,,and what he done was he just sort of eyeballed
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.24,0:03:30.90,csapp,,0,0,0,,what his company was able to do in terms of of building the very new of semiconductors 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.90,0:03:33.96,csapp,,0,0,0,,and it was the very very early days of integrated circuits
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.10,0:03:37.48,csapp,,0,0,0,, when you could put multiple transistors on a single chip
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.26,0:03:42.32,csapp,,0,0,0,, and what he recognized was there is sort of a curve of 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.80,0:03:55.46,csapp,,0,0,0,,met that on this axis it's how much does it cost to per transistor to manufacture a system
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.72,0:04:01.22,csapp,,0,0,0,,and on the right hand side it's how many transistors there were on a single chip
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.84,0:04:05.44,csapp,,0,0,0,,and what he observed was through sort of a sweet spot and if you're to the left
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.28,0:04:11.48,csapp,,0,0,0,,you're basically you're not putting enough things on the chip and so you have too many chips 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.28,0:04:15.38,csapp,,0,0,0,,and they cost a lot to connect them together 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.68,0:04:17.72,csapp,,0,0,0,,and you're not making use of the technology 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.22,0:04:19.84,csapp,,0,0,0,,and if you go too far to the right 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.98,0:04:24.42,csapp,,0,0,0,,then you're trying to squeeze more on that chip than it was economically feasible at the time
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.28,0:04:28.78,csapp,,0,0,0,,and what he also observed was and this is 65 remember 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.78,0:04:32.84,csapp,,0,0,0,,so he was basically projecting from 3 years worth of data
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.62,0:04:35.64,csapp,,0,0,0,,that that curve was dropping
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.12,0:04:40.38,csapp,,0,0,0,, that and so this sweet spot was shifting to 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.08,0:04:45.64,csapp,,0,0,0,,telling you what's the optimum number of devices to put on a single chip
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.22,0:04:55.68,csapp,,0,0,0,, from like 20 here 250 there too and then he projected out and said well gee by 1970
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.70,0:04:57.84,csapp,,0,0,0,, we should be able to get a thousand devices on a chip 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.96,0:05:02.72,csapp,,0,0,0,,and that was sort of just a prediction he made 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.08,0:05:05.34,csapp,,0,0,0,, and then that became known as Moore's law 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.86,0:05:12.36,csapp,,0,0,0,,and that name was not made up by Moore but by actually a professor at Caltech 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.98,0:05:18.96,csapp,,0,0,0,,so what we now know of is Moore's law was really started with this prediction 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.98,0:05:22.66,csapp,,0,0,0,, and two things are worth noting one is it's a technology prediction 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.48,0:05:27.66,csapp,,0,0,0,,it's based on what this company and other companies were able to do
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.10,0:05:31.34,csapp,,0,0,0,, but the other was an economic one it was saying 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.10,0:05:38.24,csapp,,0,0,0,,if you want to make the best use of this technology and get the most sort of electronics for your dollar
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.70,0:05:40.54,csapp,,0,0,0,, then you should be following these principles
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.76,0:05:43.50,csapp,,0,0,0,,so and that that combination is actually quite important
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.44,0:05:49.12,csapp,,0,0,0,,so I went off and found a Wikipedia page that lists 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.74,0:05:54.66,csapp,,0,0,0,,a bunch of different chips for microprocessors and other types of processors
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.24,0:06:00.60,csapp,,0,0,0,, that has the both the chip area 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.38,0:06:03.92,csapp,,0,0,0,,and how many transistors who were on that 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.58,0:06:05.80,csapp,,0,0,0,,and I mapped it out 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.88,0:06:14.92,csapp,,0,0,0,,so it starts the first microprocessor was the called the 4004 made by Intel in 1971 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.92,0:06:22.00,csapp,,0,0,0,,and up through here you see that I sort of partitioned these into different types of processors
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.68,0:06:26.10,csapp,,0,0,0,, so a desktop processor would be like what you'd have in a PC
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.60,0:06:30.00,csapp,,0,0,0,,and they sort of drove the industry for this middle part of the time 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.60,0:06:35.70,csapp,,0,0,0,,embedded systems are chips that aren't designed to be computers that you're using as computers 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.74,0:06:37.82,csapp,,0,0,0,,but they're inside of something 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.82,0:06:45.84,csapp,,0,0,0,,for example the earliest micro processors the 4004 was created by Intel to 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.42,0:06:52.24,csapp,,0,0,0,,to run a calculus cop calculator built by a Japanese company
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.24,0:06:57.20,csapp,,0,0,0,, they came to Intel and said could you make us some electronics to implement this 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.72,0:07:00.50,csapp,,0,0,0,,and somebody within Intel I had the inspiration to say well
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.92,0:07:06.26,csapp,,0,0,0,,if we just implement this as a microprocessor then we can write the code to implement a desktop calculator
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.92,0:07:09.60,csapp,,0,0,0,,and it's what they call 4-bit microprocessor so 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.04,0:07:13.02,csapp,,0,0,0,,you're used to 32 mentioned 4 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.00,0:07:15.48,csapp,,0,0,0,,so the word size is 4 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:15.84,0:07:20.74,csapp,,0,0,0,,and how do you do that it's actually you have to think about how you even do that
Dialogue: 0,0:07:20.74,0:07:23.06,csapp,,0,0,0,,but that's what it was a 4-bit microprocessor 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.86,0:07:25.96,csapp,,0,0,0,,so anyways embedded systems sort of 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.44,0:07:29.20,csapp,,0,0,0,,some of these were really a pre PC era 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.22,0:07:35.42,csapp,,0,0,0,,and then these diamonds are ones that sort of drove the PC era 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.14,0:07:39.86,csapp,,0,0,0,,and then the yellow are more recent graphic processor units 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.72,0:07:43.84,csapp,,0,0,0,,which are some of the biggest fastest chips out there
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.40,0:07:49.44,csapp,,0,0,0,, the x's are ones that are really server class machines for example the sharp machines 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.18,0:07:53.22,csapp,,0,0,0,,and are designed to be inside of a big computer room 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.10,0:07:59.72,csapp,,0,0,0,,and down here for exempt these blue ones are actually for cell phones 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.84,0:08:03.86,csapp,,0,0,0,,but this is just this is not a scientific sample it's just 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:04.30,0:08:06.84,csapp,,0,0,0,,a ones for which I could find the appropriate data 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.32,0:08:11.70,csapp,,0,0,0,,oh and you might ask why did you start in 1971 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:12.32,0:08:15.12,csapp,,0,0,0,,if this paper came out in 65 well 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.18,0:08:20.86,csapp,,0,0,0,,back in 65 the technology was what they called bipolar technology 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.52,0:08:23.98,csapp,,0,0,0,,which is not a mental condition here and 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:26.22,0:08:28.05,csapp,,0,0,0,,the it's very different
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.16,0:08:29.94,csapp,,0,0,0,,so the first microprocessor 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:31.24,0:08:35.08,csapp,,0,0,0,,and all the successor ones are done in a technology called MOS 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.54,0:08:41.62,csapp,,0,0,0,,which stands for metal oxide semiconductor which isn't a very useful name
Dialogue: 0,0:08:41.62,0:08:48.54,csapp,,0,0,0,, but basically chips since the early 70s have dominantly been using this technology 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:48.58,0:08:49.82,csapp,,0,0,0,,and the current one is called CMOS
Dialogue: 0,0:08:51.46,0:08:55.60,csapp,,0,0,0,,so anyways the interesting thing you'll see here is on this vlog scale 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:56.18,0:09:00.12,csapp,,0,0,0,,you'll see that this doubling every two years has almost exactly matched 
Dialogue: 0,0:09:01.10,0:09:01.82,csapp,,0,0,0,,what's happened 
Dialogue: 0,0:09:03.32,0:09:13.52,csapp,,0,0,0,,so the gray line is if I just extrapolated from from 50 transistors in 1965 and predicted
Dialogue: 0,0:09:13.52,0:09:15.12,csapp,,0,0,0,, they would double every two years 
Dialogue: 0,0:09:15.80,0:09:16.80,csapp,,0,0,0,,you get the gray line
Dialogue: 0,0:09:17.58,0:09:21.98,csapp,,0,0,0,,and the black line is what I get running a regression on this data 
Dialogue: 0,0:09:22.46,0:09:24.78,csapp,,0,0,0,,and you'll see that their scopes are exactly the same
Dialogue: 0,0:09:25.50,0:09:29.04,csapp,,0,0,0,,and what that means is the doubling every two years is absolutely true 
Dialogue: 0,0:09:29.76,0:09:33.88,csapp,,0,0,0,,the black line what it says is well actually they in the early days
Dialogue: 0,0:09:33.90,0:09:35.78,csapp,,0,0,0,, they got ahead of a curve somewhat
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.38,0:09:44.06,csapp,,0,0,0,, so that the first microprocessor for example the four thousand four had around 
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.24,0:09:45.70,csapp,,0,0,0,,well actually I have the numbers 
Dialogue: 0,0:09:46.06,0:09:48.92,csapp,,0,0,0,,actually add 1700 transistors so 
Dialogue: 0,0:09:49.84,0:09:53.74,csapp,,0,0,0,,not too far off of what word predicted for 1970 
Dialogue: 0,0:09:55.46,0:10:02.32,csapp,,0,0,0,,so anyways that's the point it's an amazing thing this is held and you might ask why was like Gordon Moore the
Dialogue: 0,0:10:03.04,0:10:09.50,csapp,,0,0,0,, the best a forecaster of the future ever to be able to nail this number so precisely 
Dialogue: 0,0:10:10.20,0:10:15.00,csapp,,0,0,0,,and also why do you call it a law so there's two things going there's a few things going on here
Dialogue: 0,0:10:14.32,0:10:16.57,csapp,,0,0,0,, first of all this is not a
Dialogue: 0,0:10:16.57,0:10:20.06,csapp,,0,0,0,,law it's not a law of nature it's not a
Dialogue: 0,0:10:20.06,0:10:23.20,csapp,,0,0,0,,law of our country it's not a law of of
Dialogue: 0,0:10:23.20,0:10:26.18,csapp,,0,0,0,,anything it's just a statement that he
Dialogue: 0,0:10:26.18,0:10:30.58,csapp,,0,0,0,,made but also it's become a
Dialogue: 0,0:10:30.58,0:10:33.47,csapp,,0,0,0,,self-fulfilling aw meaning that because
Dialogue: 0,0:10:33.47,0:10:34.94,csapp,,0,0,0,,Gordon Moore who was a very prominent
Dialogue: 0,0:10:34.94,0:10:37.88,csapp,,0,0,0,,tourist at that time said this and said
Dialogue: 0,0:10:37.88,0:10:39.86,csapp,,0,0,0,,his company in that direction and he
Dialogue: 0,0:10:39.86,0:10:44.14,csapp,,0,0,0,,then went on to found in tell by the way
Dialogue: 0,0:10:44.14,0:10:49.22,csapp,,0,0,0,,he and and all of his colleagues and his
Dialogue: 0,0:10:49.22,0:10:51.86,csapp,,0,0,0,,sort of burgeoning business have just
Dialogue: 0,0:10:51.86,0:10:53.69,csapp,,0,0,0,,been dedicated to the task of making
Dialogue: 0,0:10:53.69,0:10:56.89,csapp,,0,0,0,,this a law so it was a prediction but
Dialogue: 0,0:10:56.89,0:10:59.20,csapp,,0,0,0,,not in a sort of objective sense it was
Dialogue: 0,0:10:59.20,0:11:02.14,csapp,,0,0,0,,a prediction by somebody who then
Dialogue: 0,0:11:02.14,0:11:04.98,csapp,,0,0,0,,motivated other people to fulfill it
Dialogue: 0,0:11:04.98,0:11:08.02,csapp,,0,0,0,,so anyways it's pretty interesting that

Dialogue: 0,0:31:55.67,0:31:57.98,csapp,,0,0,0,,got the number that it's doubled roughly
Dialogue: 0,0:31:57.98,0:32:02.60,csapp,,0,0,0,,every 10 years the area of the chip so

Dialogue: 0,0:32:57.05,0:32:59.39,csapp,,0,0,0,,keep scaling up area and expect that to
Dialogue: 0,0:32:59.39,0:33:03.32,csapp,,0,0,0,,happen well the other factor which is we

Dialogue: 0,0:33:05.36,0:33:08.21,csapp,,0,0,0,,gotten smaller and so the way I'll I'll
Dialogue: 0,0:33:08.21,0:33:11.12,csapp,,0,0,0,,measure that is I'll take this measure I
Dialogue: 0,0:33:11.12,0:33:14.72,csapp,,0,0,0,,call L this linear metric
Dialogue: 0,0:33:14.72,0:33:17.60,csapp,,0,0,0,,of chip density I'll say the area of

Dialogue: 0,0:33:20.87,0:33:23.03,csapp,,0,0,0,,transistors and so one way to think
Dialogue: 0,0:33:23.03,0:33:24.98,csapp,,0,0,0,,about it is if the transistors were
Dialogue: 0,0:33:24.98,0:33:27.92,csapp,,0,0,0,,spread in a sort of uniform grid across
Dialogue: 0,0:33:27.92,0:33:31.25,csapp,,0,0,0,,a chip then their spacing would be this

Dialogue: 0,0:33:33.53,0:33:35.54,csapp,,0,0,0,,they're denser in some places and more
Dialogue: 0,0:33:35.54,0:33:37.31,csapp,,0,0,0,,spread out and others but sort of if you
Dialogue: 0,0:33:37.31,0:33:39.77,csapp,,0,0,0,,think of this as a way to look overall
Dialogue: 0,0:33:39.77,0:33:42.11,csapp,,0,0,0,,how close we packed our transistors to
Dialogue: 0,0:33:42.11,0:33:46.49,csapp,,0,0,0,,each other oh and this is the curve you

Dialogue: 0,0:33:50.42,0:33:52.40,csapp,,0,0,0,,and you see this one really is a pretty
Dialogue: 0,0:33:52.40,0:33:55.37,csapp,,0,0,0,,strong trend of getting a finer and
Dialogue: 0,0:33:55.37,0:34:02.39,csapp,,0,0,0,,finer geometries over time and it's so
Dialogue: 0,0:34:02.39,0:34:06.17,csapp,,0,0,0,,the linear scale it drops by a factor of
Dialogue: 0,0:34:06.17,0:34:09.14,csapp,,0,0,0,,two every five years but if you think
Dialogue: 0,0:34:09.14,0:34:12.68,csapp,,0,0,0,,about the number of things the density
Dialogue: 0,0:34:12.68,0:34:16.52,csapp,,0,0,0,,therefore goes by a factor of four every
Dialogue: 0,0:34:16.52,0:34:22.61,csapp,,0,0,0,,five years and so that's or equivalent
Dialogue: 0,0:34:22.61,0:34:24.08,csapp,,0,0,0,,we have gotten twice as many transistors

Dialogue: 0,0:34:34.78,0:34:40.27,csapp,,0,0,0,,that if you measure out for the Intel

Dialogue: 0,0:34:52.42,0:34:54.94,csapp,,0,0,0,,so those you know about chip technology
Dialogue: 0,0:34:54.94,0:34:56.77,csapp,,0,0,0,,might know that the AAA

Dialogue: 0,0:35:19.99,0:35:23.41,csapp,,0,0,0,,finest geometry there but this measure L
Dialogue: 0,0:35:23.41,0:35:26.44,csapp,,0,0,0,,is bigger because it counts for not just
Dialogue: 0,0:35:26.44,0:35:28.84,csapp,,0,0,0,,out what how closely you can pack wires
Dialogue: 0,0:35:28.84,0:35:32.11,csapp,,0,0,0,,but all the other stuff you have to put
Dialogue: 0,0:35:32.11,0:35:33.94,csapp,,0,0,0,,transistors there you have to route

Dialogue: 0,0:35:38.11,0:35:39.85,csapp,,0,0,0,,each other so this is actually a more
Dialogue: 0,0:35:39.85,0:35:42.16,csapp,,0,0,0,,useful measure of of the effect of
Dialogue: 0,0:35:42.16,0:35:48.34,csapp,,0,0,0,,spacing on a chip um so just to again if
Dialogue: 0,0:35:48.34,0:35:50.62,csapp,,0,0,0,,you're not so familiar with this kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:35:50.62,0:35:54.01,csapp,,0,0,0,,geometry let's just give you some idea
Dialogue: 0,0:35:54.01,0:35:58.80,csapp,,0,0,0,,of it so this range in nanometers then
Dialogue: 0,0:35:58.80,0:36:01.72,csapp,,0,0,0,,between a thousand and a million then is
Dialogue: 0,0:36:01.72,0:36:03.73,csapp,,0,0,0,,is sort of something smaller than a
Dialogue: 0,0:36:03.73,0:36:06.76,csapp,,0,0,0,,millimeter right a million nanometers is
Dialogue: 0,0:36:06.76,0:36:09.88,csapp,,0,0,0,,a millimeter so a thousand nanometers is
Dialogue: 0,0:36:09.88,0:36:13.12,csapp,,0,0,0,,a micron or a micrometer and so this
Dialogue: 0,0:36:13.12,0:36:16.75,csapp,,0,0,0,,range which is where semiconductor
Dialogue: 0,0:36:16.75,0:36:20.88,csapp,,0,0,0,,processing was up till ten years ago
Dialogue: 0,0:36:20.88,0:36:23.38,csapp,,0,0,0,,you'd call it the submillimetre range
Dialogue: 0,0:36:23.38,0:36:26.74,csapp,,0,0,0,,and in this it's in the sub micrometer
Dialogue: 0,0:36:26.74,0:36:29.41,csapp,,0,0,0,,range so just to give you some sense of
Dialogue: 0,0:36:29.41,0:36:32.50,csapp,,0,0,0,,what those scales mean and I'll point
Dialogue: 0,0:36:32.50,0:36:34.30,csapp,,0,0,0,,out that it's pretty incredible to talk

Dialogue: 0,0:36:41.35,0:36:45.34,csapp,,0,0,0,,is a lot so again if you look at here's

Dialogue: 0,0:40:45.02,0:40:47.36,csapp,,0,0,0,,what's our defect on our thinking one is
Dialogue: 0,0:40:47.36,0:40:48.92,csapp,,0,0,0,,to assume that we're going to just take

Dialogue: 0,0:40:58.34,0:40:59.87,csapp,,0,0,0,,because that's exactly what's happened
Dialogue: 0,0:40:59.87,0:41:03.80,csapp,,0,0,0,,over the past 50 years but we have three
Dialogue: 0,0:41:03.80,0:41:05.72,csapp,,0,0,0,,dimensions in this world and so maybe
Dialogue: 0,0:41:05.72,0:41:09.02,csapp,,0,0,0,,there's some prospect there so let's say
Dialogue: 0,0:41:09.02,0:41:12.43,csapp,,0,0,0,,instead okay let's imagine
Dialogue: 0,0:41:12.43,0:41:16.39,csapp,,0,0,0,,a little brick of stuff and I'll just
Dialogue: 0,0:41:16.39,0:41:18.10,csapp,,0,0,0,,make up some numbers I'll say it's 2
Dialogue: 0,0:41:18.10,0:41:20.59,csapp,,0,0,0,,centimeters on a side and 5 millimeters
Dialogue: 0,0:41:20.59,0:41:23.92,csapp,,0,0,0,,high it's almost exactly the same shape

Dialogue: 0,0:41:29.16,0:41:33.87,csapp,,0,0,0,,and so and now let's just imagine okay
Dialogue: 0,0:41:33.87,0:41:37.45,csapp,,0,0,0,,how are we going to integrate a bunch of

Dialogue: 0,0:41:38.95,0:41:43.24,csapp,,0,0,0,,build it out of layers and so let's just
Dialogue: 0,0:41:43.24,0:41:45.52,csapp,,0,0,0,,assume that there's about a hundred
Dialogue: 0,0:41:45.52,0:41:48.70,csapp,,0,0,0,,thousand layers worth of stuff and those
Dialogue: 0,0:41:48.70,0:41:50.23,csapp,,0,0,0,,are what I'll call logical layers
Dialogue: 0,0:41:50.23,0:41:55.42,csapp,,0,0,0,,meaning that they'll be about a million
Dialogue: 0,0:41:55.42,0:41:57.49,csapp,,0,0,0,,physical layers because we have to have
Dialogue: 0,0:41:57.49,0:42:00.58,csapp,,0,0,0,,wires and these whatever we're building
Dialogue: 0,0:42:00.58,0:42:03.16,csapp,,0,0,0,,will be just these totally flat things
Dialogue: 0,0:42:03.16,0:42:07.33,csapp,,0,0,0,,nowadays there's a modern chip has more
Dialogue: 0,0:42:07.33,0:42:16.63,csapp,,0,0,0,,like 20 physical layers on it so but the
Dialogue: 0,0:42:16.63,0:42:18.16,csapp,,0,0,0,,point is that we'll have to have about a
Dialogue: 0,0:42:18.16,0:42:20.23,csapp,,0,0,0,,million physical layers worth of stuff
Dialogue: 0,0:42:20.23,0:42:23.22,csapp,,0,0,0,,to get a hundred thousand logical wires
Dialogue: 0,0:42:23.22,0:42:27.18,csapp,,0,0,0,,but that would allow us a spacing on the
Dialogue: 0,0:42:27.18,0:42:30.75,csapp,,0,0,0,,linear spacing of about 20 nanometers so
Dialogue: 0,0:42:30.75,0:42:34.96,csapp,,0,0,0,,20 nanometers is a lot better than a 63
Dialogue: 0,0:42:34.96,0:42:39.10,csapp,,0,0,0,,picometers right if we go back 20
Dialogue: 0,0:42:39.10,0:42:43.90,csapp,,0,0,0,,nanometers is up in here so it's really
Dialogue: 0,0:42:43.90,0:42:47.86,csapp,,0,0,0,,really small but it's not it's not
Dialogue: 0,0:42:47.86,0:42:50.62,csapp,,0,0,0,,beyond a physical possibility let's just
Dialogue: 0,0:42:50.62,0:42:53.31,csapp,,0,0,0,,put it that way so you can imagine some
Dialogue: 0,0:42:53.31,0:42:56.14,csapp,,0,0,0,,technology that would give you that so
Dialogue: 0,0:42:56.14,0:43:00.42,csapp,,0,0,0,,at least at some level it's it's vaguely
Dialogue: 0,0:43:00.42,0:43:02.98,csapp,,0,0,0,,you know it's aggressive but but
Dialogue: 0,0:43:02.98,0:43:08.38,csapp,,0,0,0,,possible to imagine in 50 years be able
Dialogue: 0,0:43:08.38,0:43:10.84,csapp,,0,0,0,,to manufacture in a shape like that
Dialogue: 0,0:43:10.84,0:43:14.25,csapp,,0,0,0,,something with 10 to the 17th devices
Dialogue: 0,0:43:14.25,0:43:19.68,csapp,,0,0,0,,but there's a few problems one is
Dialogue: 0,0:43:19.68,0:43:22.12,csapp,,0,0,0,,actually the manufacturing how we do
Dialogue: 0,0:43:22.12,0:43:23.64,csapp,,0,0,0,,actually do this is no small thing
Dialogue: 0,0:43:23.64,0:43:26.17,csapp,,0,0,0,,another I'll talk about some is
Dialogue: 0,0:43:26.17,0:43:28.42,csapp,,0,0,0,,do we do this and not spend a whole lot
Dialogue: 0,0:43:28.42,0:43:30.22,csapp,,0,0,0,,an exorbitant amount of money doing it
Dialogue: 0,0:43:30.22,0:43:33.10,csapp,,0,0,0,,and the other is a huge huge problem of
Dialogue: 0,0:43:33.10,0:43:36.06,csapp,,0,0,0,,power consumption how can we actually
Dialogue: 0,0:43:36.06,0:43:39.70,csapp,,0,0,0,,have a system that complicated and keep
Dialogue: 0,0:43:39.70,0:43:42.07,csapp,,0,0,0,,it at the limited energy level we have
Dialogue: 0,0:43:42.07,0:43:44.89,csapp,,0,0,0,,available so let me go into that some
Dialogue: 0,0:43:44.89,0:43:48.13,csapp,,0,0,0,,more so just is a sort of tutorial the
Dialogue: 0,0:43:48.13,0:43:50.26,csapp,,0,0,0,,way these chips are made and part of the
Dialogue: 0,0:43:50.26,0:43:52.03,csapp,,0,0,0,,reason they're so cheap is it's it's
Dialogue: 0,0:43:52.03,0:43:55.17,csapp,,0,0,0,,sort of a photo process meaning that
Dialogue: 0,0:43:55.17,0:43:59.23,csapp,,0,0,0,,every step of the way is done by putting
Dialogue: 0,0:43:59.23,0:44:02.29,csapp,,0,0,0,,a some kind of material down and
Dialogue: 0,0:44:02.29,0:44:06.69,csapp,,0,0,0,,exposing it to a light a laser light and
Dialogue: 0,0:44:06.69,0:44:09.94,csapp,,0,0,0,,then that's this material that you put
Dialogue: 0,0:44:09.94,0:44:13.21,csapp,,0,0,0,,down as light-sensitive and so there's a
Dialogue: 0,0:44:13.21,0:44:15.40,csapp,,0,0,0,,mask that defines how things should be
Dialogue: 0,0:44:15.40,0:44:18.88,csapp,,0,0,0,,patterned and the light only hits where
Dialogue: 0,0:44:18.88,0:44:21.61,csapp,,0,0,0,,the mask is allows it to and that's how
Dialogue: 0,0:44:21.61,0:44:24.22,csapp,,0,0,0,,you get different shapes and things and
Dialogue: 0,0:44:24.22,0:44:26.80,csapp,,0,0,0,,you can either add material or you can
Dialogue: 0,0:44:26.80,0:44:29.11,csapp,,0,0,0,,remove material by these masking steps
Dialogue: 0,0:44:29.11,0:44:32.56,csapp,,0,0,0,,so nowadays a modern chip takes about 60
Dialogue: 0,0:44:32.56,0:44:35.92,csapp,,0,0,0,,of these steps we're involving a mask
Dialogue: 0,0:44:35.92,0:44:38.59,csapp,,0,0,0,,and some type of either depositing
Dialogue: 0,0:44:38.59,0:44:40.60,csapp,,0,0,0,,something or removing something or
Dialogue: 0,0:44:40.60,0:44:44.65,csapp,,0,0,0,,shining light on it or a beam of ions or
Dialogue: 0,0:44:44.65,0:44:48.76,csapp,,0,0,0,,some other process step to do it so it's
Dialogue: 0,0:44:48.76,0:44:51.63,csapp,,0,0,0,,very complicated than the technology is
Dialogue: 0,0:44:51.63,0:44:54.19,csapp,,0,0,0,,quite remarkable but what you could say
Dialogue: 0,0:44:54.19,0:44:59.83,csapp,,0,0,0,,is that the even though there's a couple
Dialogue: 0,0:44:59.83,0:45:01.90,csapp,,0,0,0,,billion transistors on a chip
Dialogue: 0,0:45:01.90,0:45:05.05,csapp,,0,0,0,,it still is a constant time process some
Dialogue: 0,0:45:05.05,0:45:07.98,csapp,,0,0,0,,fixed number of steps and it's done and
Dialogue: 0,0:45:07.98,0:45:11.56,csapp,,0,0,0,,each successive generation maybe the
Dialogue: 0,0:45:11.56,0:45:13.42,csapp,,0,0,0,,number of masking steps is increased a
Dialogue: 0,0:45:13.42,0:45:15.70,csapp,,0,0,0,,little bit over time but roughly
Dialogue: 0,0:45:15.70,0:45:18.25,csapp,,0,0,0,,speaking it's always a constant time
Dialogue: 0,0:45:18.25,0:45:22.05,csapp,,0,0,0,,operation and it turns out that the
Dialogue: 0,0:45:22.05,0:45:25.30,csapp,,0,0,0,,bottleneck in this and the performance
Dialogue: 0,0:45:25.30,0:45:27.84,csapp,,0,0,0,,one is actually this photolithography
Dialogue: 0,0:45:27.84,0:45:32.76,csapp,,0,0,0,,exposing the chip the the the wafer
Dialogue: 0,0:45:32.76,0:45:35.74,csapp,,0,0,0,,using a mask and the way that's done
Dialogue: 0,0:45:35.74,0:45:38.71,csapp,,0,0,0,,nowadays is a machine called a stepper
Dialogue: 0,0:45:38.71,0:45:39.82,csapp,,0,0,0,,that
Dialogue: 0,0:45:39.82,0:45:42.79,csapp,,0,0,0,,basically is used to scan over the wafer
Dialogue: 0,0:45:42.79,0:45:46.81,csapp,,0,0,0,,and expose with a laser sort of flashing
Dialogue: 0,0:45:46.81,0:45:52.06,csapp,,0,0,0,,as it goes to expose the wafer to this
Dialogue: 0,0:45:52.06,0:45:56.17,csapp,,0,0,0,,mask and so current-day that's done it a
Dialogue: 0,0:45:56.17,0:46:03.79,csapp,,0,0,0,,on a size of about eight hundred nine
Dialogue: 0,0:46:03.79,0:46:05.86,csapp,,0,0,0,,hundred square millimeters so you know
Dialogue: 0,0:46:05.86,0:46:09.85,csapp,,0,0,0,,about this bigger size how much they can
